## Bash-scripts

The core of this repository is a set of Bash-scripts in
[`ðŸ“‚ .bashrc.d`](./.bashrc.d/) that are sourced as part of `ðŸ“„ ~/.bashrc`.

See [`ðŸ“‚ install`](./install/README.md) for installation instructions.

## Static modifications

Apart from the Bash-scripts, there's a set of static/manual modifications in
[`ðŸ“‚ static`](./static/README.md).

### WSL2

To setup a WSL2 instance, _copy_ [`ðŸ“„ wsl.conf`](./static/linux/etc/wsl.conf)
and [`ðŸ“„ resolv.conf`](./static/linux/etc/resolv.conf) to `ðŸ“‚ /etc` â€” on the
Windows-side, copy [`ðŸ“„ .wslconfig`](./static/windows/.wslconfig) and
[`ðŸ“„ .wslgconfig`](./static/windows/.wslgconfig) to `ðŸ“‚ %USERPROFILE%`.

Several of the Bash-scripts rely on the modifications made in these
configuration files to function properly.

#### systemd

In their default state, the Bash-scripts and configuration files assume the WSL2
instance is running **`systemd`**.

When using Microsoft's `/init` system, copy
[`ðŸ“„ wsl.init.conf`](./static/linux/etc/wsl.init.conf) to `ðŸ“‚ /etc` instead (and
rename it to `ðŸ“„ wsl.conf`) and `chmod +x`
[`ðŸ“„ .bashrc.d/30-x11-wsl`](./.bashrc.d/30-x11-wsl).

In this case no services are started automatically, so several required services
are started through `ðŸ“„ /etc/wsl.conf`. Furthermore, a `dbus`-session (required
for X11/GUI-applications) is launched.

#### systemd - Caveats

Although generally speaking, systemd works fine, there's a handful of caveats to
be aware of:

- It is recommended to change the default target to "multi-user.target":
  - `sudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target`
  - See <https://github.com/arkane-systems/bottle-imp#requirements>
- To prevent `systemd-remount-fs` from failing (resulting in a
  "degraded"-state), remove the `LABEL=cloudimg-rootfs`-line from `/etc/fstab`
  - Ubuntu-specific â€“ apart from this, fstab should be empty; as the entry
    didn't do anything to begin with (no filesystem labelled `cloudimg-rootfs`
    present) it seems safe to remove...
  - See <https://randombytes.substack.com/i/74583493/systemd-remount-fsservice>
- See [`ðŸ“‚ /usr/lib/binfmt.d`](static/linux/usr/lib/binfmt.d/README.md) if
  you're running into issues with **WSL-interop**
