# Windows' `ðŸ“‚ %USERPROFILE%`

## WSL2 - `.wslconfig`

This configuration requires
[WSL **2.0.5**](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/releases/tag/2.0.5) (or higher)
in _combination_ with **Windows 11 23H2**.

- Enables `mirrored` networking-mode, DNS tunneling and Hyper-V firewall support
- Sets automatic memory reclamation to `gradual`
- Enables sparse VHDs for new WSL2-instances
  - In case of an existing WLS-instance:
    `wsl --manage <distro> --set-sparse true`

For more details on these options, see:
<https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/windows-subsystem-for-linux-september-2023-update/>.

In case networking-mode is set to `nat` (the only option available pre-`2.0.0`),
the `SharedAccess`-service on the Windows-side needs to be allowed through
[Simplewall](https://github.com/henrypp/simplewall) for WSL2 to have
(_unrestricted_) network access. The (post-`2.0.0`) `mirrored` networking-mode
with Hyper-V firewall support enabled offers a superior solution (where firewall
rules on the Windows-side extend into WSL2 as well).

Note that enabling `mirrored` networking-mode will cause ports to be shared
between Windows and WSL2 which might cause issues with certain services (e.g.
SSHd). Disable either one, or move one to a different port â€“ optionally use
[`experimental.ignoredPorts`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl-config#experimental-configuration-settings)
to exclude the port on the WSL2-side (making that service only available inside
WSL2 itself).

With regards to SSHd, it's probably wisest to disable the service altogether on
both Windows and WSL2 as I never remotely access my laptop...
