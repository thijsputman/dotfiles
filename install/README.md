## Install

Run `ðŸ“„ install.sh` to setup [`ðŸ“‚ .bashrc.d`](../.bashrc.d/), create various
configuration file symlinks, and make some further
[configuration changes](#configuration-changes).

`ðŸ“„ install.sh` Runs all executable files in [`ðŸ“‚ install/parts.d`](./parts.d/).
To enable/disable parts of the installation, simply `chmod +x/-x` the scripts in
question prior to running the installer.

The scripts in `ðŸ“‚ install/parts.d` are idempotent. They can be run multiple
times on an already "installed" system without nasty side-effects.

During installation, `ðŸ“„ ~/.env` is created from
[a defaults file](./../.env.default) which lists all possible environment
variables (without setting any of their values). Make sure to fill out all
relevant environment variables before continuing.

### Prerequisites

The below software should be installed for the scripts in `ðŸ“‚ .bashrc.d` to
function properly.

- **neofetch** â€” `sudo apt install neofetch`
- **direnv** â€” `sudo apt install direnv`
- **pyenv** â€” `curl https://pyenv.run | bash`
- **powerline-go** â€” retrieve the latest binary from
  <https://github.com/justjanne/powerline-go> and store as
  `ðŸ“„ ~/.local/bin/powerline-go`.

Note that none of these dependencies pose a hard requirement; missing
dependencies are handled gracefully by the various scripts.

### Configuration changes

A handful of scripts in `ðŸ“‚ parts.d` make configuration changes instead of
symlinking files from this Git-repository:

- ðŸŸ¢ [`ðŸ“„ 90-motd`](./parts.d/90-motd) â€” removes some unnecessary clutter from
  the default MOTD
- ðŸš« [`ðŸ“„ 90-ubuntu-pro`](./parts.d/90-ubuntu-pro) â€” removes additional clutter
  from MOTD and `apt` introduced by Ubuntu Pro
- ðŸš« [`ðŸ“„ 91-apt-add-repository`](./parts.d/91-apt-add-repository) â€” adds a set
  of third-party `apt`-repositories (Node.js, Microsoft, etc.)

Scripts marked with ðŸš« are not executable by default.

### Git configuration

The Git user configuration (i.e., name and e-mail address) is split from the
main configuration in `ðŸ“„ ~/.gitconfig_personal`. To add additional
(folder-based; dynamic) user configurations, modify `ðŸ“„ ~/.gitconfig` along the
lines of:

```conf
[include]
  path = .gitconfig_personal
[includeIf "gitdir:GitHub/folder_XXX/"]
  path = .gitconfig_XXX
[includeIf "gitdir:GitHub/folder_YYY/"]
  path = .gitconfig_YYY
[alias]
  ...
```

To prevent a locally modified version of `ðŸ“„ ~/.gitconfig` from (accidentally)
getting committed back into the repository, this "trick" can be applied:

```shell
git update-index --assume-unchanged .gitconfig
```

Note that remote updates to the file (i.e., `git pull`) will _nuke_ your local
changes, so use with caution! This of course works for any â€” locally modified â€”
files you don't want to commit back into the repository...

To undo:

```shell
git update-index --no-assume-unchanged .gitconfig
```

### Raspberry Pi

By default, `ðŸ“„ install.sh` installs the WSL2-setup. To have it install the
Raspberry Pi-setup instead, do this prior running the installer:

```bash
chmod +x ./parts.d/*-rpi
chmod -x ./parts.d/*-wsl
```

## Uninstall

To "uninstall", run these commands in `ðŸ“‚ ~/`:

```bash
find -lname '**/dotfiles/**' -delete
rm ~/.env
rm -rf ~/.anacron
crontab -l | grep -v '^@hourly .* $HOME/.anacron/etc/anacrontab' | crontab -
cp /etc/skel/.bashrc ~/.bashrc
```

This removes all symlinks pointing to `ðŸ“‚ **/dotfiles/**` (assuming that's what
this Git-repository is called), removes `ðŸ“„ ~/.env` and `ðŸ“‚ ~/.anacron` created
during installation, removes the anacron `crontab`-entry, and restores
`ðŸ“„ ~/.bashrc` to its default state.

Omit `-delete` from the first command to get a list of symlinks instead of
deleting them and manually remove the ones you don't need anymore.

Note that this does _not_ undo any of the
[configuration changes](#configuration-changes).
