- [Uninstall](#uninstall)

## Install

Run `ðŸ“„ install.sh` to setup [`ðŸ“‚ ~/.bashrc.d`](../.bashrc.d/), create various
configuration file symlinks, and make some further
[configuration changes](#configuration-changes).

`ðŸ“„ install.sh` Runs all executable files in [`ðŸ“‚ parts.d`](./parts.d/). To
enable/disable parts of the installation, simply `chmod +x/-x` the scripts in
question prior to running the installer.

It is possible to run a _single_ part by using `install.sh <part>` (e.g.
`install.sh 20-home` would execute [`ðŸ“„ parts.d/20-home`](./parts.d/20-home)).
This is the preferred way of running single parts on-demand â€“ most of them
depend on variables set by `install.sh` and thus cannot be run directly.

The scripts in `ðŸ“‚ parts.d` are idempotent. They can be run multiple times on an
already "installed" system without nasty side-effects.

During installation, `ðŸ“„ ~/.env` is created from
[a defaults file](./../.env.default) which lists all possible environment
variables (without setting any of their values). Make sure to fill out all
relevant environment variables before continuing.

### Prerequisites

The below packages are required for the scripts in `ðŸ“‚ ~/.bashrc.d` to function
properly. See the `9*install`-scripts listed under
[configuration changes](#configuration-changes) for installation instructions.

- `neofetch`
- `direnv`
- `pyenv`
- `powerline-go`

Note that none of these pose a hard requirement; missing dependencies are
handled gracefully by the various scripts in `ðŸ“‚ ~/.bashrc.d`.

#### [`ðŸ“‚ bins.d`](./bins.d)

A handful of convenience scripts are provided that either pull binaries directly
from GitHub, or have fully customised installation procedures.

Simply run any of the scripts in [`ðŸ“‚ bins.d`](./bins.d) to pull the predefined
version of the tool into `ðŸ“‚ ~/.local/bin` â€“ or `ðŸ“‚ ~/.go/bin` for tools
compiled from Go, overwriting any pre-existing version of the tool.

The scripts pulling in binaries attempt to automatically determine the correct
processor architecture; in general they should thus work for both `amd64` and
`arm64` systems.

To install a non-predefined version of a tool, do:

```shell
version=v2.12.0 ./hadolint
```

### Configuration changes

A handful of scripts in [`ðŸ“‚ parts.d`](./parts.d/) make configuration changes
instead of symlinking files from this Git-repository:

- ðŸŸ¢ [`ðŸ“„ 90-motd`](./parts.d/90-motd) â€” removes some unnecessary clutter from
  the default MOTD
- ðŸš« [`ðŸ“„ 90-ubuntu-pro`](./parts.d/90-ubuntu-pro) â€” removes additional clutter
  from MOTD and `apt` introduced by Ubuntu Pro
- ðŸš« [`ðŸ“„ 91-apt-add-repository`](./parts.d/91-apt-add-repository) â€” adds a set
  of third-party `apt`-repositories (Node.js, Microsoft, etc.)
- ðŸš« [`ðŸ“„ 92-apt-install`](./parts.d/92-apt-install) â€” installs several
  apt-packages
- ðŸš« [`ðŸ“„ 92-snap-install`](./parts.d/92-snap-install) â€” installs several snaps
- ðŸš« [`ðŸ“„ 93-go-install`](./parts.d/93-go-install) â€” compiles binaries for
  several tools written in Go
- ðŸš« [`ðŸ“„ 93-install`](./parts.d/93-install) â€” installs several packages that
  don't come via `apt`, `snap`, or `go`
  - This steps also executes all scripts in [`ðŸ“‚ bins.d`](./bins.d)

Scripts marked with ðŸš« are not executable by default.

### Git configuration

The Git user configuration (i.e., name and e-mail address) is split from the
main configuration in `ðŸ“„ ~/.gitconfig_personal`. To add additional
(folder-based; dynamic) user configurations, modify `ðŸ“„ ~/.gitconfig` along the
lines of:

```conf
[include]
  path = .gitconfig_personal
[includeIf "gitdir:GitHub/folder_XXX/"]
  path = .gitconfig_XXX
[includeIf "gitdir:GitHub/folder_YYY/"]
  path = .gitconfig_YYY
[alias]
  ...
```

To prevent a locally modified version of `ðŸ“„ ~/.gitconfig` from (accidentally)
getting committed back into the repository, this "trick" can be applied:

```shell
git update-index --assume-unchanged .gitconfig
```

Note that remote updates to the file (i.e., `git pull`) will _nuke_ your local
changes, so use with caution! This of course works for any â€” locally modified â€”
files you don't want to commit back into the repository...

To undo:

```shell
git update-index --no-assume-unchanged .gitconfig
```

### Raspberry Pi

By default, `ðŸ“„ install.sh` installs the WSL2-setup. To have it install the
Raspberry Pi-setup instead, do this prior running the installer:

```bash
chmod +x ./parts.d/*-rpi
chmod -x ./parts.d/*-wsl
```

## Uninstall

To "uninstall", run these commands in `ðŸ“‚ ~/`:

```bash
find -lname '**/dotfiles/**' -delete
rm ~/.env
rm -rf ~/.anacron
crontab -l | grep -v '^@hourly .* $HOME/.anacron/etc/anacrontab' | crontab -
cp /etc/skel/.bashrc ~/.bashrc
```

This removes all symlinks pointing to `ðŸ“‚ **/dotfiles/**` (assuming that's what
this Git-repository is called), removes `ðŸ“„ ~/.env` and `ðŸ“‚ ~/.anacron` created
during installation, removes the anacron `crontab`-entry, and restores
`ðŸ“„ ~/.bashrc` to its default state.

Omit `-delete` from the first command to get a list of symlinks instead of
deleting them and manually remove the ones you don't need anymore.

Note that this does _not_ undo any of the
[configuration changes](#configuration-changes).
